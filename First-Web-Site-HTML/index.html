      A twist on the Arthurian legend which brings Merlin (Colin Morgan) back as
      a young boy who acts as servant to Prince Arthur (Bradley James). The
      warlock must come to terms with his destiny to protect the Prince from
      harm, all the while being at risk of being exposed as a sorceror.
